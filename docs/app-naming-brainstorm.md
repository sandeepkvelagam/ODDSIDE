# App Naming Brainstorm

> Replacing: **Kvitt** — *"Your side settled."*

## Context

The app is a poker home-game ledger and settlement tool for friend groups. It tracks buy-ins, chips, cash-outs, and calculates who owes whom after a game. It's a "pro tool for friends" — not a casino app.

## Top Candidates

### 1. SidePot — *"Your Game Night. Settled."*

A side pot is a core poker concept. The name immediately signals poker + money management. Short, memorable, and domain-perfect.

- Pros: Poker-native, two syllables, descriptive, great brand potential
- Cons: Two words (though common for app names)

### 2. Ante — *"Deal Yourself In."*

The ante is the first thing on the table — it signals the start of every game. Clean, one-word, universally recognized poker term.

- Pros: One word, universally understood, action-oriented
- Cons: May conflict with existing apps/brands

### 3. Stackd — *"Track. Play. Settle."*

Refers to chip stacks. The dropped vowel gives it a modern, app-native feel. Punchy three-word tagline mirrors the app flow.

- Pros: Modern naming convention, brandable, unique
- Cons: Dropped vowel trend may feel dated

### 4. Feltt — *"Where Friends Settle Up."*

The felt is the poker table surface — where everything happens. Double-t makes it brandable and unique. Tagline emphasizes the social/friend aspect.

- Pros: Unique spelling, poker-native, emphasizes social element
- Cons: May require explaining the poker reference

### 5. NightCap — *"Close Out Every Game Night."*

Double meaning: the end-of-evening ritual + "capping" off the game. Casual, social, and captures the post-game settlement moment.

- Pros: Fun double meaning, social vibe, easy to remember
- Cons: Less explicitly poker-related

## Recommendation

**SidePot** is the top recommendation. It's poker-native, immediately communicable, and the two-syllable structure works well for brand, app icon, domain, and social handles.
