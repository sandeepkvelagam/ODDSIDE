# App Naming Brainstorm

> Replacing: **Kvitt** — *"Your side settled."*

## Context

The app is a card-game ledger and settlement tool for friend groups. It tracks buy-ins, chips, scores, cash-outs, and calculates who owes whom after a game. It's a "pro tool for friends" — not a casino app.

**Scope:** The app will support multiple card games — poker, rummy, teen patti, and more. The name must be **game-agnostic** and not tied to any single game.

**Naming constraint:** Must be a **made-up/invented word** — real English words and common gaming terms are already taken.

## Top Candidates (Invented Names)

### 1. Skora — *"Every Score. Settled."*

Invented from "score." Sounds Scandinavian/Nordic — sleek, dark, premium. Fits the cinematic aesthetic perfectly.

- Pros: 5 letters, easy to say and spell, Nordic cool, implies scoring/tracking
- Cons: Slight similarity to "score" (but distinct enough as a brand)

### 2. Rekko — *"Reckon Up. Game On."*

Invented from "reckon" (to calculate/settle accounts). Friendly but smart. Two punchy syllables.

- Pros: Implies calculation/settlement, fun to say, memorable, works across all games
- Cons: Two syllables (though that's standard for app names)

### 3. Staka — *"Raise the Stakes. Settle the Night."*

Invented from "stake/stack." Bold and edgy with a Nordic undertone. Naturally implies money on the line.

- Pros: Strong brand energy, implies stakes/money, bold sound, premium feel
- Cons: Could be misread as "stacker"

### 4. Vynt — *"Your Game Night. Handled."*

Completely invented. 4 letters. Evokes "vintage" game nights. Short, sharp, luxury-brand feel.

- Pros: Ultra-short, premium sound, unique, very available as domain/handle
- Cons: No obvious meaning (though that can be a pro for brand building)

### 5. Spliq — *"Split. Clean."*

Invented from "split" with a hard Q ending. Implies clean settlement between players.

- Pros: Edgy modern sound, implies splitting/settling, unique Q ending, memorable
- Cons: Might need pronunciation help (rhymes with "sleek")

## Recommendation

**Skora** is the top recommendation. It's invented but instantly evocable ("score"), sounds premium and Nordic (matching the dark cinematic brand), and is short enough to work as a domain, app icon, and social handle. It scales across poker, rummy, teen patti, and any future game.

**Runner-up: Rekko** — if you want something warmer and more approachable.
