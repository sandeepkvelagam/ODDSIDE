# App Naming Brainstorm

> Replacing: **Kvitt** — *"Your side settled."*

## Context

The app is a card-game ledger and settlement tool for friend groups. It tracks buy-ins, chips, scores, cash-outs, and calculates who owes whom after a game. It's a "pro tool for friends" — not a casino app.

**Scope:** The app will support multiple card games — poker, rummy, teen patti, and more. The name must be **game-agnostic** and not tied to any single game.

## Top Candidates (Game-Agnostic)

### 1. Shuffl — *"Your Game Night. Handled."*

Shuffling is the one action that starts **every** card game — poker, rummy, teen patti, all of it. Modern dropped-vowel branding keeps it sleek.

- Pros: Universal card game action, modern and brandable, works with dark/cinematic aesthetic
- Cons: Dropped vowel trend (though still widely used in tech)

### 2. Wildcard — *"Your Game Night Ledger."*

Wildcards exist in poker, rummy, and most card games. Bold, memorable, and has a cool "unexpected edge" connotation.

- Pros: Universal across card games, bold and memorable, great brand potential
- Cons: Two syllables, may have existing apps with similar name

### 3. Dealr — *"Deal. Play. Settle."*

Dealing cards is universal to all card games. Modern naming convention. Three-word tagline mirrors the app flow perfectly.

- Pros: Universal, modern naming, action-oriented tagline
- Cons: Dropped vowel trend, may need pronunciation clarification

### 4. NightCap — *"Close Out Every Game Night."*

Completely game-agnostic. Double meaning: end-of-night ritual + wrapping up the game. Captures the settlement moment regardless of what you played.

- Pros: Fun double meaning, social vibe, works for any game type
- Cons: Less obviously tied to card games

### 5. Kitty — *"Every Game Night. Settled."*

The "kitty" is the communal pot in both poker AND rummy (and many other card games). Short, memorable, and naturally fits the money-tracking purpose.

- Pros: Used across multiple card games, short and catchy, directly relates to money pool
- Cons: May sound too casual for the cinematic brand aesthetic

## Recommendation

**Shuffl** is the top recommendation. It represents the universal action that starts every card game, sounds modern and sleek, and scales naturally as you add poker, rummy, teen patti, and beyond. It pairs well with the existing dark/cinematic brand aesthetic.

**Runner-up: Wildcard** — if you want something bolder and more distinctive.
