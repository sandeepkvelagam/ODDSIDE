## Confirmation Tone

Instead of: "Transfer successful!"
Use: "Transfer complete."

Instead of: "Funds have been added to your wallet."
Use: "Funds secured."

## Sentence Length Rule

Under 12 words whenever possible. Compress. Never pad.

## Color Philosophy

- 60% Dark Base
- 30% Orange (Primary Attention) `#EE6C29`

Words must match visual calmness.
